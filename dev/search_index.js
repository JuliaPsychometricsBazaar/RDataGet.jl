It is an alternative to RDatasets.jl, working on demand, rather than bundling data.\n\nThe basic usage is similar to RDatasets.jl. You can install it as follows:\n\n    Pkg.add(\"RDataGet\")\n\nAfter installing the RDataGet package, you can then load data sets using the dataset() function, which takes the name of a package and a data set as arguments:\n\n    using RDataGet\n    harman_political = dataset(\"psych\", \"Harman.political\")\n    neuro = dataset(\"boot\", \"neuro\")\n\nLimitations\n\nThis package currently just downloads source packages from CRAN and loads its dataset into memory in Julia. It does not depend on R itself.\n\nThe package has a few limitation, some of which are caused by this design, while others could be addressed in future:\n\nDoes not support built-in R datasets, including the datasets package, only ones which can be downloaded from CRAN\nCan only load rda/RData/csv.gz files in the data directory\nAs such it does not support packages which generate their data using a build script\nCannot get any descriptions or further documentation related to the datasets from Julia (maybe TODO but needs .Rd parsing)\nOnly supports getting the latest version of each package (TODO)\nFixed, very-limited caching strategy\nThe package index is re-downloaded every time we need to download any package (so as to find the latest version number) (TODO: should be by-default cached per session + longer caching allowed)\nPackages are downloaded exactly once per session, after which the same data is reused until Julia is restarted (TODO: should be customisable for longer caching)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#RDataGet.dataset","page":"Home","title":"RDataGet.dataset","text":"dataset(package_name, dataset_name) -> Any\ndataset(package_name, dataset_name, types) -> Any\ndataset(\n    package_name,\n    dataset_name,\n    types,\n    cran_mirror\n) -> Any\n\n\nTries to find dataset_name the data directory of the R package package_name. The data table is loaded directly from an RData or CSV file in package source. Sometimes, not all columns can be successfully typed from CSVs, and so types can be provided which will be passed to CSV.File.\n\nAn alternative cran_mirror can be specified, by default default_cran_mirror= \"https://cloud.r-project.org/\" is used.\n\nAfter first load, the data will be cached as an arrow file.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#RDataGet.datasets","page":"Home","title":"RDataGet.datasets","text":"datasets(package_name) -> DataFrame\ndatasets(package_name, cran_mirror) -> DataFrame\n\n\nLists the datasets found in the data directory of the package_name R package along with some basic metadata in a DataFrame.\n\nAn alternative cran_mirror can be specified, by default default_cran_mirror= \"https://cloud.r-project.org/\" is used.\n\nThis will currently cause all datasets in the package to be cached.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
